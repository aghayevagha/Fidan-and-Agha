# Sieve of Eratosthenes Performance Measurement

This Python script (`sieve_performance.py`) implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and measures its performance over multiple iterations. The performance is then visualized using Matplotlib.

## Overview

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting from 2. This script measures the time it takes to execute the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm 1000 times, prints the average performance, and displays a plot showing the time taken for each attempt.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sieve-of-eratosthenes-performance.git
   cd sieve-of-eratosthenes-performance
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python sieve_performance.py
  

   This will execute the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm 1000 times, print the average performance, and display a plot showing the time taken for each attempt.

## Script Explanation

- `sieve_of_eratosthenes(n)`: Function that generates a list of boolean values indicating whether each number up to a given limit is prime using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

- `measure_performance(n)`: Function that measures the performance of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm over `n` iterations, calculates the average performance, and visualizes the performance over each attempt using Matplotlib.

- `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))`: Adjusts the figure size for the Matplotlib plot to make it wider (10 inches width, 5 inches height).

- `plt.plot(range(1, n + 1), performance_times, marker='o')`: Plots a line graph where the x-axis represents the attempt number, and the y-axis represents the time taken in seconds for each iteration.

## Results

After running the script, you will see the average performance printed in the console, and a Matplotlib plot will be displayed showing the performance over each attempt. On Kaggle platform we achieved a promising result
`Average Performance: 0.03347372627258301 seconds` </br>
